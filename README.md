- Our group chose Picita Abad's artwork Wheels of Fortune, which suggests movement and change, perhaps hinting at the unpredictability of fate, and from my perspective, the vibrant colors and superimposed circles seem to be a myriad of breathing beings.

- Therefore, I wanted to make the circle in the image that would zoom in and out so that the graphic would seem to be breathing, and make the graphic turn by rotating it left and right to make the image more vivid and impactful.

### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
- Circle Scaling
  
  After the circle is drawn, the circle is scaled by the change of the diameter size, and the speed of the diameter scaling is set to control the speed of the graphical changes, and the circle is scaled in reverse by using the if function with speed*=-1.

- Circle Rotation
  
  Use translate ( ) to move the origin of the drawing coordinate system to the center of the canvas, calculate the angle of rotation by tan ( ) and PI, and use a for loop to encircle the circle around the center of the circle.
